Description
A very simple app that does nothing more than conveniently store and display PDF certificates. You can use it for public transport tickets, bills, contracts, certificates and any other PDF file.
The PDF file has to be imported into the app. Following that, the barcode is displayed in fullscreen, as well as the PDF document itself. That's already it.

Currently supported barcode formats are:
- Matrix (2D) codes: QR, Aztec, DataMatrix and PDF417
- Linear (1D) codes: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, CODE-39, CODE-93, CODE-128, ITF and Codabar

More Features
- Can detect and extract barcodes in PDFs
- (Optional) fingerprint authentication
- PDFs can be individually sorted and named
- PDFs can be opened
- PDFs can be shared from other apps
- PDFs can be shared with other apps (indirectly allows printing)
- Dark Mode support (document stays in original color)
- Also supports password protected PDFs

The "Pro" version additionally brings (requires In-App Purchase):
- Removes "Get Pro" banner on various screens
- Option to invert document colors in dark mode
- Option to force dark or light theme by overriding system settings

Why does the generated barcode look different from the one in the PDF?
The algorithm used for display is different. For reading devices the code is identical.
